# Salary-Classification-of-Data-Scientists-based-on-a-survey

Kaggle has hosted an open data scientist competition in 2018 titled “2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge.” The purpose of this challenge was to “tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.”

The dataset provided (mutiplechoiceResponses.csv) contains the survey results provided by Kaggle. The survey results from 23860 participants are shown in 395 columns, representing survey questions. Not all questions are answered by each participant, and responses contain various data types

Classification is a supervised machine learning approach used to assign a discrete value of one variable when given the values of others. Many types of machine learning models can be used for training classification problems, such as logistic regression, decision trees, kNN, SVM, random forest, gradient-boosted decision trees and neural networks.

Work involves:
1. Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding (label or one-hot encoding)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Selection of features using lasso regularizer and reducing dimensionality with Prinicpal Component Analysis
4. Model implementation using logistic regression 
5. Model tuning using grid search
